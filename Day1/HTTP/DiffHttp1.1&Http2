HTTP 1.1:
What is HTTP 1.1?
HTTP 1.1 is a widely used protocol transferring the data over 
the world wide web.
HTTP 1.1 works on the textual format.
It compress data by itself.

Advantages of Http 1.1:

1.persistent connections:
HTTP 1.1 allows multiple requests and responses to be over a 
single Tcp/ip connection.

2.pipelining:
HTTP 1.1 supports request pipelining,where multiple requests 
can be sent without waiting for each response.

3.Chunked transfer encoding:
HTTP 1.1 introduces the chunked transfer encoding,which enables 
the server send  data to variable size chunks rather than 
in a single block.

4.Host header:
HTTP1.1 requires a host header in every request,allowing servers
to host multiple websites on the same IP address and port 
combination.

5.caching improvements:
HTTP1.1 introduces the caching mechanisms,including support for cache validators.Its helps
to reduce the bandwidth and improve performance.

Disadvantages of Http1.1:
1.increase complexity(for use modern applications)
2.Inefficient use of network resources.

HTTP 2:
What is HTTP2?
HTTP2 is a major version of the HTTP.
It is used to communicate data world wide web.
It was developed by IETF MAY 2015.HTTP 2 works on the binary protocol.
It uses HPACK for data compression.

Advantages:
1.Multiplexing:
HTTP2 allows multiple requests and response to be send and receive 
concurrently over a single Tcp connection.
2.Header compression:
HTTP2 employs header compression techniques to reduce overhead 
by compressing header compressing Http fields.
3.server push
4.Binary protocol
5.stream prioritization.

Disadvantages:
1.complexity
2.Resource consumption.
3.middlebox compatibility.
